Abstract
This paper investigates the size of fiscal multipliers in Denmark for high and low debt regimes. The analysis is based on new data spanning the period from 1948 to 2020. The relationship between the nominal interest rate and GDP growth rate is used to identify high and low debt periods. The relationship exploits that intertemporal budget constraints are only binding when this relationship is positive. The main findings are: First, the response of output of a government shock has increased since the adoption of a fixed exchange rate regime. Second, the output multiplier is significantly higher in low debt periods.
